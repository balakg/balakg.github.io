I am an Assistant Professor in the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) department at Rice University. I focus on developing scalable and reliable computer vision methods, and apply much of my work to scientific domains such as medical and geospatial imaging. I am also part of the Rice Digital Health Initiative and Houston Methodist-Rice Digital Health Institute.
