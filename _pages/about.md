I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://eceweb.rice.edu/">Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)</a> department at Rice University. My group advances the efficiency and reliability of learning algorithms for signal representation and generation, particularly for real-world applications such as medical imaging, environmental science, and 3D scene reconstruction. I am also part of the <a href="https://dhi.rice.edu/">Rice Digital Health Initiative</a> and <a href="https://www.hmrdhi.org/">Houston Methodist-Rice Digital Health Institute</a>.

I completed my PhD at MIT CSAIL advised by John Guttag and Frédo Durand, and my postdoctoral research under Bill Freeman. I completed my B.S. degrees in Computer Science and Computer Engineering at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.
